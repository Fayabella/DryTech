the voices in my head tell me to compress fluids. i say "yes ma'am" and compress fluids. i end up flooding my friend's space station again. this is the third time. when will it end

worry no longer. DryTechâ„¢ doors will keep your interiors dry, even when faced with fluids compressed beyond the density needed to create a [black hole.](https://www.desmos.com/calculator/kgpmkxwj3e)


Currently implemented:
- A variety of fluid-blocking doors
- Some pressure displays (1x20, and compact scientific notation) that work with [this pressure sensor mod](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2883446019)

To-do:
- add recipes for the added objects
- pressurized fluids causing damage / pressurized debuff
- pressure canisters for holding unfathomable amounts of fluid, canning machine to create them
- drytech fluid thruster. i will not elaborate
